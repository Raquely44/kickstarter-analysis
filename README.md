# Kickstarter Analysis Complete

### Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to compare Louise's play *Fever* to other campaigns with similar Launch dates and fundraising goals. We also would like to visualize campaign outcome based on their launch date and funing goals. As a result, I hope to provide better insight into these two factors that have yeilded successful campaigns.

### Analysis and Challenges
I looked at Theater outcomes based on Launch Months, which can also be filtered by year. The graph shows each months Successful, Failed, and Canceled Theater campaigns' count.

Based on earlier analysis, we were able to determine that there were outliers that skewed our data, showing the average to be closer to the upper (qualiteral) as shown in the descriptive stats workbook. [https://github.com/Raquely44/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Resources/Descriptive%20Stats.png] Instead of looking at all plays soley based on subcatagory and country, I catagorized plays based on their goal amount. Then calculted the successful, failed, and canceled percentage and created a line graph below.

### Results
From the analysis we can determine the best months to start a campaign are May and June where as the worst month is December. The best goal amount is less than $1,000 and the worst is $45,000 to $49,999. It is interesting to note that the second most successful campaign by goal amount is 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999 range. Some limiations would be...
I would recommend determining the length of the campaign to better understand revenue forcasting. I would also recommend analyizing how many backers if took to fund campaigns based on category and goal amount to understand the interest of our audience.
