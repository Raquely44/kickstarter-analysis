# Kickstarter Analysis Complete

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to compare Louise's play Fever to other campaigns with similar launch dates and fundraising goals. We also would like to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch date and funing goals. As a result, I hope to provide better insight into these two factors that have yeilded successful campaigns in th past.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I looked at Theater outcomes based on the month is was launched, which can also be filtered by year. The graph shows each months' Successful, Failed, and Canceled Theater campaigns' count.

### Analysis of Outcomes BAsed on Goals
Based on earlier analysis, we were able to determine that there were outliers that skewed our data, showing the average to be closer to the upper (qualiteral) as shown in the descriptive stats workbook. [https://github.com/Raquely44/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Resources/Descriptive%20Stats.png] Instead of looking at all plays soley based on subcatagory and country, I catagorized plays based on their goal amount. Then calculted the successful, failed, and canceled percentage and created a line graph as a visual representation of the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge with this data was formating the dates from time stamps into a formate that is more easily read. I was able to use a simple excel formula to calculate the date.

## Results
- From the analysis we can determine the best months to start a campaign are May and June where as the worst month is December. We can also conclude that there is a trend line from the months of January to May upwards that show a an increase in successful campaigns launched in this time period, with the exception of the month of March. 
- The most successful goal amount is less than $1,000 and the least is $45,000 to $49,999. It is interesting to note that the second most successful campaign by goal amount is $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 range. 
- A limiation of the data is that we do not know if all campaigns were marketed using the same plateforms and how much was spent on each campaign. This can have a major impact on how successful the campaign was. 
- I would recommend determining the length of the campaign to better understand campaign success forcasting shown as a line chart. I would also recommend analyizing how many backers it took to fund campaigns based on category and goal amount to understand the interest of our audience shown as a bar graph.
